# RENDEX

Rendex is a Casio Graphics Calculator add-in developed purely as a proof of concept, in order to see how far the SuperH3 architecture and a monochromatic screen can be pushed. The final concept is to have a software renderer that can load OBJ files, and render meshes and also rasterize models and transform them in real time.

## Installation

Unfortunately, setting up a development envrionment is woesome, but to install it on your own SH3 Casio calculator, download rendex.G1A from the release section, and either look into installing [p7](https://p7.planet-casio.com/), or [FA-124](https://edu.casio.com/education/support_software/dl/PC_links/fa124_inst_204_2.zip) to use in accordance with a USB cable or 3-pin cable to transfer the file onto your calculator as an add-in.

#### P7 command (UNIX based Operating systems)

```bash
sudo p7 send "path to rendex.g1a"
```
#### FA-124 command (Windows)
```bash
FA-124 is GUI based application, so just click and dragging will pull you through here :)
```
